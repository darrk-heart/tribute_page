        "Kobe Bryant played the final game of his NBA career, and like he did throughout his 20year career, he made a statement in his farewell game, like only he can.

Scoring a brilliant 60 points, Kobe made sure the last game of his stellar career would be one to remember, leading his Los Angeles Lakers team to a 101-96 victory with some ridiculous basketball in the final minutes."
